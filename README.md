# Lumiere

An experimental ray tracing library and application written in Ocaml. This project is not
meant to be the fastest or the best written ray tracer ever built. Instead, I'm using this
project, while following
[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html),
to learn more about Ocaml and functional programming in general.

## Building

To build this project you will have to have [dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) installed,
along with a Ocaml environment setup.

```bash
$ dune build
$ dune exec lumiere
```
